# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: Areo Leo, a fidget spinner enthusiast and designer in China, reflects on his journey with the toy. He claims to have designed the most number of spinners in China but acknowledges that quantity doesn't equate to quality. His interest began after watching a video about fidget spinners and he started designing them using 3D software. The popularity of fidget spinners peaked in May 2017 before sharply declining; however, some designs like the Krait spinner remained popular despite market downturns. There were differing opinions on counterfeit designs' impact on creativity and market growth. As interest waned, many enthusiasts moved onto other Everyday Carry (EDC) items.

Today, I walked around neighborhood areas previously unexplored and found myself cast in a wave of nostalgia. It compelled me to pen this article, to reflect on my journey as a fidget spinner enthusiast in China. 

## Who am I?

I'm a fidget spinner enthusiast and probably the designer with the most original designs for fidget spinners in all of China. If you've delved deeply into the fidget spinner community, you may have heard of me. 

While it may seem boastful, it's true that I'm one of the designers who has independently designed the most number of spinners in the country. I've designed over a dozen models. I can't claim to have the most designs globally, but I'm confident that I'd be within the top five.

Does that sound arrogant? It's not meant to. The fidget spinner enthusiast community in China is relatively small, and having the most designs doesn't necessarily mean having the best.

## The Beginning 

About a year and a half ago, I watched a video introducing fidget spinners on the 'B' site. The video bewitched me, making me obsess day and night over this small device. I never thought then that it would have left such an imprint on my life.

Back then, a fidget spinner in China cost more than 500 yuan. This price made it a toy that I could only adore, not possess. Later, I saw a post on the forum advertising a 3D-printed spinner for just over 100 yuan. Even that though was an investment for a high schooler like me. However, the temptation proved too strong to resist.

## The Journey 

After that, I bought another spinner from @XiaolangTOWER. That plain, plastic spinner is still one of my favorites.

The most famous spinners at that time were the GUN model and the Caesar spinner. CKF2.0 was available for pre-order, and the design for MetalWorn's "Bacon" had just been released.  None of the authors of these designs could have imagined that their creations would become two of the most replicated models in China.

Empowered by 3D software, I decided to draft my first spinner design, which currently now lies forgotten by all. 

As the months rolled on, I expanded my portfolio with more designs. Each one was a manifestation of my growing interest in crafting mesmerizing renderings. 

## The Shift

Around May 2017, the search index for fidget spinners in China reached its peak – the toy had become the talk of the town. But by June, the search index sharply decreased. The market for fidget spinners began to slump, dipping below figures from three months ago.



## Recognizing the Ups and Downs

It was not all doom and gloom, though. Some designers swam against the current, like the designer of the Krait spinner. Post-June, the Krait spinner dominated the market, a favorite among many spinner enthusiasts in China. This demonstrates that committed designers and enthusiasts could still make the most of a market that was witnessing a downturn.

There was a stark divide when it came to attitudes towards legitimate and counterfeit spinners. Some argued that counterfeit designs stifled the creativity and motivation of original designers and deterred growth, but others saw counterfeiting as a necessary evil for market development.

As the fidget spinner trend began to fade, most of us ventured into other EDC (Everyday Carry) items. 

## A Note To My Fellow Enthusiasts

For those who've read this far, you must truly love fidget spinners. It took an hour and a half for me to gather my thoughts and write this piece. I must admit, I initially anticipated focusing on the *past year*, but ended up including a broader timeline. 

In the end, it’s through fidget spinners that I've met so many people and underwent so many experiences. Even though my focus on designing spinners has waned lately, these little toys remain an unforgettable part of my life.

With my upcoming examination in mind,
