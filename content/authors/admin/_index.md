Meet Aero Leo, the dynamic CEO at the helm of Jiezhi Tech, an organization that is carving its niche in the world of embedded computer systems. As a leader, Aero is driven by innovation and a commitment to delivering exceptional solutions to clients.

Aero's professional interests are diverse, but Rubik's cube & EDC (Everyday Carry) design holds a special place in his repertoire. The intricate engineering and complexity of these items captivate him, and he applies the same problem-solving and creative thinking to his role at Jiezhi Tech.

When not immersed in the world of tech, Aero indulges in his passion for photography. He believes that just like a well-designed system or a solved Rubik's cube, a great photograph captures a moment of clarity amidst the world's complexity. Each photo is a reflection of perspective and the ability to view things differently, principles that he instills in his professional life.
